    <h1>Design Direction Mockups Placeholder</h1>
    <p>This file is a placeholder for an interactive design direction visualizer that would typically be generated by a UX designer tool.</p>
    <p>Below are descriptions of a few design directions for key screens based on our discussions, using Material-UI components and the "Professional & Trustworthy" theme.</p>

    <h2>Key Screens for Mockups:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**Document Upload & Initial Analysis Trigger:** Entry point for primary user action.</li>
        <li>**Analysis Results & Cover Letter Display:** Core value presentation (feedback, generated content).</li>
        <li>**Qualification Gaps & Improvement Suggestions:** Detailed gap analysis screen/section.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="direction-section">
        <h2>Design Direction 1: Focused & Sequential Flow</h2>
        <h3>Philosophy: Professional & Efficient</h3>
        <p>This direction emphasizes a clear, step-by-step process, minimizing distractions and guiding the user through each stage of the application process. Uses a clean, card-based layout with clear primary calls to action.</p>
        
        <h4>Screen: Document Upload & Initial Analysis Trigger</h4>
        <div class="screen-mockup">
            <p><strong>Layout:</strong> Centralized, single column form with distinct Material-UI Card components for CV and Job Posting uploads.</p>
            <p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Clear drag-and-drop zones, or click to browse. A prominent, primary-colored "Analyze Application" button at the bottom, initially disabled.</p>
            <p><strong>Visual:</strong> Minimal text, clear icons. Focus on progress indicator after upload.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Screen: Analysis Results & Cover Letter Display</h4>
        <div class="screen-mockup">
            <p><strong>Layout:</strong> Two-column layout. Left column for a summary of results (e.g., keyword match score, quick gaps). Right column for the generated cover letter, editable in a Material-UI TextField.</p>
            <p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Tabs or Accordions for switching between different sections of the analysis (e.g., "Cover Letter", "Keywords", "Improvements").</p>
            <p><strong>Visual:</strong> Clear Material-UI typography, subtle dividers. Export options (PDF, DOC, MD) as secondary buttons.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Screen: Qualification Gaps & Improvement Suggestions</h4>
        <div class="screen-mockup">
            <p><strong>Layout:</strong> List-based display of gaps, each in a Material-UI ListItem or Card. Each item shows the missing qualification and a concise AI-generated suggestion.</p>
            <p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Expandable sections for more detailed suggestions. Option to "Mark as reviewed" or "Add to plan".</p>
            <p><strong>Visual:</strong> Uses Material-UI's data display components for clarity. Green/red indicators for aligned/missing keywords.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="direction-section">
        <h2>Design Direction 2: Dash-based Overview & Flexible Exploration</h2>
        <h3>Philosophy: Empowering & Comprehensive</h3>
        <p>This direction provides users with a more dashboard-like experience, offering an overview of all analysis results on a single screen, with options to drill down into details. Emphasizes flexibility and exploration.</p>
        
        <h4>Screen: Document Upload & Initial Analysis Trigger</h4>
        <div class="screen-mockup">
            <p><strong>Layout:</strong> Similar upload component, but integrated into a broader dashboard. "Upload new application" might be a prominent card or section.</p>
            <p><strong>Interaction:</strong> After analysis, the dashboard updates to show a summary of the latest application results. Less sequential, more about immediate overview.</p>
            <p><strong>Visual:</strong> More data visualization (charts for keyword match, progress bars). Uses Material-UI Grid for flexible layout.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Screen: Analysis Results & Cover Letter Display</h4>
        <div class="screen-mockup">
            <p><strong>Layout:</strong> Single-page scrollable view. Generated cover letter might be a primary section, with keyword analysis and gap analysis sections following directly below, perhaps in collapsable Material-UI Accordions.</p>
            <p><strong>Interaction:</strong> All information is present on one screen, reducing navigation. Export buttons are clearly visible but less prominent than the cover letter itself.</p>
            <p><strong>Visual:</strong> Uses Material-UI Paper and Typography to separate content blocks. More emphasis on scanning than direct comparison.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Screen: Qualification Gaps & Improvement Suggestions</h4>
        <div class="screen-mockup">
            <p><strong>Layout:</strong> An integrated section on the main results dashboard, using Material-UI DataGrid or a custom table component for a dense, filterable list of gaps.</p>
            <p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Filter/sort options for gaps. Quick actions directly within the list item for suggestions.</p>
            <p><strong>Visual:</strong> Higher information density, but still readable with Material-UI's table components. Clear visual cues for actionable items.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>In a fully interactive version, you would navigate through these mockups, experience interactive elements, and see them adapt to different screen sizes.</p>
